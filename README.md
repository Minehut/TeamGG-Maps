# Maps
These are all the maps currently used on the Minehut [Warzone](https://warzone.network) server! Make sure before you add maps that they have the correct license to be used on our server (Commercial license). All uploaded maps must be pruned! If you don't know how to prune a map, you can always ask for help on our [Discord](https://discord.io/WarzoneMC) or our [Forums](https://warzone.network).

## Tips
When you make a pull request, our friendly code bot Codacy will automatically check for any errors in the JSON. It will tell you exactly what you got wrong and where to fix it. If you do not fix the errors it finds, your pull request will not be accepted. The easiest way to get support if you have any errors on the JSON would be to contact a *Map Developer* on our [discord](https://discord.io/WarzoneMC).
